Type

	./configure; make -j; make install-strip

to build xfig and install it below /usr/local. The option -j causes a parallel
build, install-strip strips debugging symbols from executables.
Important options to configure are
	--prefix=<path>		root of installation tree, default /usr/local
	--without-xpm-icon	disable the xpm splash icon
	--with-appdefaultdir=<path>	directory to install the X resources
				file to, default /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/
	--with-icondir=<path>	directory to install the xfig icon to,
				default $prefix/share/pixmaps/
	--with-applicationsdir=<path>	directory for the xfig.desktop file,
				default $prefix/share/applications/
	--without-xfig-libraries	do not install xfig libraries files,
				currently 2531 fig files, 16 MB.
Type ./configure --help for all options.

*** Important note ***
This is the first release using the autoconf system. Several options, which were
previously available in the xmkmf / Imakefile build system, are not yet
implemented. I am sorry for the inconvenience. This release is really a bit
roughly packaged. The next version should be more polished. Please send patches
or suggestions for improvement to thomas.loimer@tuwien.ac.at.
